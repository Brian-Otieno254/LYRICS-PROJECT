          <p>
            [verse 1]<br />I found a love for me<br />Oh, darlin' just dive
            right in and follow my lead<br />Well, I found girl beautiful and
            sweet<br />Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus]<br />'Cause
            we were just kids when we fall in love<br />Not knowin' what it
            was<br />I will not give you up this time<br />But, darlin' just
            kiss me slow<br />Your heart is all I own<br />And your eyes, you're
            holdin' mine<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Baby, I'm dancing' in the dark
            with you between my arms<br />Barefoot on the grass while listenin'
            to our favourite song<br />When you said you looked a mess, I
            whispered underneath my breath<br />But you heard it, darlin' you
            look perfect tonight<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />Well, I found a woman
            stronger than anything I know<br />She shares my dreams, I hope
            that, someday, I'll share her home<br />Ifound a love to carry more
            than just my secrets<br />To carry love, to carry children of our
            own<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus]<br />We were still kids, but we're so in
            love<br />Fightin' against all odds<br />I know we'll be alright
            this time<br />Darlin' just hold my hand<br />Be my girl, I'll be
            your man<br />I see my future in your eyes<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Baby,
            I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms<br />Barefoot on
            the grass while listenin' to our favourite song<br />When I saw you
            in that dress, lookin' so beautiful<br />I don't deserve this,
            darlin' you look perfect tonight<br /><br />[Bridge]<br />No, no,
            no<br />Mm, no, no<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Baby, I'm dancin' in the
            dark with you between my arms<br />Were barefoot on the grass, oh,
            listenin' to our favourite song<br />I have faith in what I see, now
            I know I have met<br />An angel in person and she looks perfect<br />I
            don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight

            [Verse 1]<br />There goes my heart beating<br />'Cause you are the
            reason<br />I'm losing my sleep<br />Please come back now<br />And
            there goes my mind racing<br />And you are the reason<br />That I'm

            goes my hands shaking<br />And you era the reason <br />My heart
            keeps bleeding<br />I need you now<br />If I could turn back the
            clock<br />I'd make sure the light defeated the dark<br />I'd spend
            every hour of avery day<br />Keeping you safe<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />I'd

            want to fight no more<br />I don't want to hide no more<br />I don't
            want to cry no more<br />Come back, I need you to hold me<br />(You
            are the reason)<br />A little closer, just a little closer now<br />Come
            a little closer, I need you to hold me tonight<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />I'd
